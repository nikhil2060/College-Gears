        <!-- Java key points -->
        <div class="min-box" id="Object-Oriented">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>It is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports the concepts of objects and
                classes, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. This enables developers
                to create complex and scalable applications using a modular and reusable approach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Platform-Independent">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>Java code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can be run on any platform that
                has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This means that Java applications can run on any device,
                including desktops, servers, mobile devices, and more, without the need for platform-specific
                modifications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Memory-Management">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>Java has an automatic memory management system, known as the Garbage Collector, which reclaims memory
                that is no longer being used by an application. This eliminates the need for manual memory management
                and reduces the risk of memory-related bugs and performance issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Security">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>Java was designed with security in mind, and provides features such as type checking, automatic array
                bounds checking, and runtime checking of program constraints. Additionally, Java applications run in a
                secure environment known as the Java Sandbox, which restricts the actions that an application can
                perform and helps to prevent security breaches.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Concurrent">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>Java provides built-in support for concurrency, which enables the development of multi-threaded
                applications that can run multiple tasks simultaneously. This makes Java well suited for building
                server-side and networked applications, as well as for developing high-performance games and other
                applications that require real-time processing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Networking">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>Java provides extensive support for network programming, with classes for working with sockets, URLs, and
                other network protocols. This makes it easy to build applications that can communicate over networks and
                the Internet, and to build distributed applications that run on multiple devices.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- C++ key points -->
        <div class="min-box" id="Template-Metaprogramming">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>C++ provides support for template metaprogramming, which enables the creation of generic, reusable code.
                This makes it possible to write code that can operate on multiple data types, improving code reusability
                and reducing the need for duplicated code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Standard-Template-Library">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides a rich set of pre-written algorithms and
                data structures, including containers, iterators, and algorithms for sorting, searching, and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Low-Level-Control">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>C++ provides low-level control over system resources, such as memory allocation and deallocation, making
                it well suited for systems programming and other performance-critical applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Performance">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>C++ is a compiled language, which means that code is translated into machine-readable form before it is
                executed. This results in faster execution times and better performance compared to interpreted
                languages like Python.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Cross-Platform">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>C++ can be compiled and run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more, making
                it well suited for cross-platform development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Large-Community">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            <p>C++ has a large and active community of developers, with a wealth of resources, including libraries,
                tools, and online forums, making it easy to find help and support when developing with C++.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="min-box" id="Dynamic-Typing">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
            JavaScript uses dynamic typing, which means that the type of a value is determined at runtime, rather than
            at compile-time.
        </div>
        <div class="min-box" id="Event-Driven-Programming">
            <i class="icon fa-sharp fa-regular fa-circle-xmark fa-2x"></i>
